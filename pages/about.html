        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>My name is William, and I am a software and web developer. To tell you about myself, I will give you a quick
            overview of my professional background. After high school, I joined the U.S. Army as a Cavalry Scout (19D). Upon leaving the 
            military, I took a year off to relax before deciding to enroll in university.
        </p>
        <h2>University</h2>
        <p>I graduated from Middle Tennessee State University with a Bachelor's degree in English Composition. During my time at MTSU, I 
            served as president of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, was accepted into the Honors College where I completed an Honors Thesis, 
            was awarded the Peck Award from the English Department, and worked as a consultant for the University Writing Center.
        </p>
        <h2>Japan and Judo</h2>
        <p>I was also fortunate enough to study abroad at Seinan Gakuin University in Fukuoka, Japan. I graduated from Seinan Gakuin with 
            a study in Japanese. During this time I also joined the univeristy Judo club. To this day, Judo is still a large part of my 
            life, and I even travel around the country to compete in Judo tournaments.
        </p>
        <h2>Careers in Copy Editing and Welding</h2>
        <p>After graduation, I worked for a few years as a professional content writer and copy editor. After getting a bit restless working 
            in an office environment, I decided to take a couple of years to try my hand in a labor-intesive trade. My friend was a welder 
            and quickly taught me the trade. Over the course of the next two years, I rose to the highest level of the trade, specializing 
            in combination pipe welding. During this time, I had a great deal of free time and finances, so I considered finally settling 
            down to learn a skill that I was always drawn to--programming. I saved money and took nearly a year off work to teach myself 
            how to program, before achieving a level of competency that I felt classified me as "job ready." As it stands, programming is 
            the profession I have decided to dedicate the rest of my life towards as a career.
        </p>
        <h2>Programming Today</h2>
        <p>In programming, I am most interested in backend web or application development. Data structures and algothrithms seem to interest
            me more than UI or visual design principals. Unfortunately, I don't have much of an eye for graphic design (as you can tell by 
            this early-2000s styled site), although I do enjoy working on UX elements as they relate to the backend. I also don't feel 
            uncomfortable when working with css or implementing css styling via JavaScript. At this point in my programming, my primary 
            goal is taking on as much responsibility as possible while advancing my skills quickly and consistently.
